# ZooProject

Start to implement the project with Git Repository, create folder your-name Project then use command of Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/GorgeousBoys/ZooProject.git
```

If you want to update your code (except some situation that you are working other branches)
```
git pull
```

Save your branch changes
```
git stash
```

Add all files changed to begin create a commit and push to this remote repository
```
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push
```

Before you are about to implement a brand new feature, make sure you must create your own branch for avoid conflict each other
```
git branch -M "your-feature"
```
